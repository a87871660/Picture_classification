# Picture_classification
Classification of pictures using convolutional neural networks.
<br>Use tesorflow to classify 5 types of images

## Data
300 pictures in each of 5 types.

## phenomenon
The code seems to be valid, but after use, it fits within 1000 steps. In the test code, the result is very bad.
<br>The loss of the training set will drop to 0, the accuracy will rise to 100%.
<br>The loss of the verification set will also drop to 0, and the accuracy will rise to 100%.

## problem
<br>
